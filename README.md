Hi ðŸ‘‹ welcome to this repo on analysing wearable biosensors signals

This is the result of a workshop where we were given some data in the form of signals from wearable biosensors linked to sleeping stages.
We were asked to analyse this data and to compare the efficacy of the different wearables to predict the sleeping stages (with polysomnography being the ground truth).

You can find the analysis in a python notebook and the report in the form of a pdf.
