Hi ðŸ‘‹ welcome to this repo on analysing wearable biosensors signals

This is the result of a workshop where we were given some data in the form of signals from wearable biosensors linked to sleeping stages.
We were asked to analyse this data and to compare the efficacy of the different wearables to predict the sleeping stages (with polysomnography being the ground truth).

You can find the analysis in a python notebook (without output cells due to large file size) and the report in the form of a pdf. The data is not provided here since it is not my property, but you can always reach out if you want more information about it.

Enjoy your reading ðŸ˜„
